            <hr>
            <h3>From Atharva College of Engineering in Mumbai</h3>
            <hr id="short-hr">
            <h5>By Vighnesh Rasal, Mumbai</h5>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My journey of becoming an Engineer started a long time ago, even longer than I understood what it really means to be an Engineer.
            It was the night 
            I watched a movie in theatre back in 2009 when I was just a kid, the movie was '3 Idiots'. And I know the movie was not encouraging audience to become 
            Engineers, rather opposite of that but I didn't care, Rancho was the character I fell in love with (most people who watched did). From then on I knew what I
            wanted to do.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years passed, I was in school at that time and didn't go to tuition. I only studied at School and Home but in 7<sup>th</sup> Grade I
            joined a local tuition classes. My tutor there saw potential in me and encouraged to pursue Engineer as a career in future. This only ignited my dreams
            again. From him I got a clearer picture of how could I become one. As someone who was interested in Science subject during School I felt that it is
            inevitable that I will one day become an Engineer. So that's exactly what happened, I took Science as a major after my 10<sup>th</sup> Grade, gave the entrance 
            test and then here I was, studying Electronics and Telecommunication in Atharva College of Engineering.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was unlucky enough to not experience about a couple years of my college life due to the pandemic, I am glad I did get to experience 
            a lot especially my final year in college was a blast. I have completed my Engineering now in 2023 with a good grade. The time I have spent studying is a
            great experience to behold but it has passed now and I stay Optimistic for the future.

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I was in school I really use to enjoy the computer lectures we had in our curriculum. I was using computers even when I was a 
            little kid since my uncle had it in his house. Most of the other kids in my school didn't have much experience using computers. When I was in 9th Grade we had HTML
            in our computer syllabus, most other fellow students were struggling, I too was strugling for a brief time initially but I learned it pretty well and as our 
            academic year passed HTML came naturally to me.<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next time The Web came to me was during my 12<sup>th</sup> Grade studies. I had HTML and JavaScript during this time in my academics,
            and this time I was more comfortable with.
            <img src= "vighnesh photo 2.jpg" alt="" id="photo-two">
            Although I was struggling with JS, my HTML skills grew even better. The next time I came across Web Development was during 
            my Engineering studies, we had a Web Design subject during this period which helped me understand Web Development better and rekindled my interest in this field. I am now
            much better in JavaScript. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College was also the time I started learning Java language. Initally though I was struggling with it, but with some more practise I was getting the hang
            it. I am currently learning Spring framework of Java. So this is the status of my Dev Journey and I have no plans to stop, not yet. Theres so much learn, so much to fail, I
            believe life is a state of constant learning.
